	 * 
	 * Anyway, to use, just type
	 * 
	 * new Func(){() -> {
	 * 		return yourStuff;

	 * Okay actually I just tried that and it didn't even work
	 * You literally just have to write out the Anonymous class :/
	 * Yo what is up with this language. And how does it allow me to use the annotation
	 * This interface is clearly not very functional
